                    <p>An activity that activates coordination between a large group of muscles in our body, this activity not only builds physical endurance, but also activates mental stability as you combine them both in an effort to reach the top. after you are done with this activity you will feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment as your muscles relax from the endurance that they have just been through. </p>
